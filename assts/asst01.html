<p>Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.</p>

<p>Write a program, <code>cypher.c</code>, that asks the user for a word and then encodes it
using a shift cypher. A shift cypher replaces each letter with a letter that is
X positions from it in the alphabet. For example, is the letter is 'a' and the
shift is 2, we replace 'a' with a 'c'. You can assume that all inputs are
lowercase and do not contain special characters.</p>

<p>Requirements and hints:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your program should implement at least one function. Try to keep your program DRY (e.g. Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>chooseWord()</code> function (defined in <code>words.h</code>) to choose a random word. Your basecode has this code in it already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your output should be similar to the sample output, although you can customize it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your program should print out whether the user guessed the word correctly or not. If the user doesn&#8217;t guess the word, you should tell the user the word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your program should give the user 6 tries to guess the word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For testing: print out the random word, or comment out the line <code>srand(time(0))</code> so that the same word is always chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your code MUST not use boolean types (vanilla C only!!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feel free to implement bonus features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Re-ask the user for a word if they enter something that is not 5 characters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t allow the user to enter words that contain characters that we know aren&#8217;t in the word</p>
